            <p class="left">“The biblical narratives throughout the Old Testament and the New trace a trajectory of mercy that leads us to welcome sexual minorities no longer as ‘strangers and aliens’ but as ‘fellow citizens with the saints and also members of the household of God’ (Eph 2:19).”</p>

If it cannot be found on the level of narrative, then it must be found on the level of allegory, metaphor, and type.”</p>

They seek an abiding city. The imprecations against the Edomites and the Babylonians are transmuted into condemnations of the world, the flesh, and the devil. If you grant the fourfold sense of scripture, David sings like a Christian.”</p>

          <section>
            <h3>Martin Luther (1483–1546)</h3>
            <p class='left'>“The entire Scripture of God is divided into two parts: commandments and promises. Although the commandments teach things that are good, the things taught are not done as soon as they are taught, for the commandments show us what we ought to do but do not give us the power to do it. They are intended to teach man to know himself, that through them he may recognize his inability to do good and may despair of his own ability.”</p>

No. Luther rather puts law in its God-given place. It threatens and restrains so that we better understand the Gospel of freedom.”</p>

            <h3>Jerome (4th century)</h3>
            <p class="left small">“This mountain is in the house of the Lord, for which the prophet sighed when he said, ‘One thing I asked from the Lord, this I seek, that I might dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life,’ and about which Paul wrote to Timothy, ‘If I am late, you should know how to behave in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and foundation of the truth.’? This house was built on the foundation of the apostles and the prophets, who are mountains themselves as imitators of Christ. About this house of Jerusalem the psalmist cried out: ‘Those who trust in the Lord are like Mount Zion, which dwells in Jerusalem; it will not be moved forever. The mountains surround her and the Lord surrounds his People.’ Hence Christ also founds his church on one of the mountains and says to him, ‘You are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of the netherworld will not prevail against her.’”</p>

              <p class="left medium">“Highlighting both continuity of the <strong>one covenant of grace</strong> stretching from Genesis 3:15 to Revelation 22:21, covenant theology also recognizes the distinction between <strong>covenants based on the principle of law</strong> (“Do this and you will live”) and <strong>those based on the principle of promise</strong> (“I will do this and you will live”). Behind these covenants lies <strong>the eternal covenant of redemption</strong>… between the persons of the Trinity that provides the foundation for God’s gracious purposes in Christ the Mediator.”</p>

            <h3>Michael Vlach</h3>
            <p class="left">“What distinguishes all dispensationalists… is belief in a restoration of Israel. The concept of restoration certainly includes the idea of salvation for Israel, but it goes beyond that. ‘Restoration’ involves the idea of Israel being reinstalled as a nation, in her land, with a specific identity and role of service to the nations. In a literal, earthly kingdom—a millennium—the nation Israel will serve a functional role to the nations (Isa. 2:2–4).”</p>

            <h3>Michael Vlach</h3>
            <p class="left small">“Dispensationalism affirms that Israel is a vehicle for bringing blessings to Gentiles (see Gen. 12:2–3), but it is not God’s intent to make Gentiles part of Israel.<br />“From Exodus 19 onward the nation Israel was the mediatorial vehicle for God’s purposes in the world. Yet with Israel’s failure, culminating in Israel’s rejection of her own Messiah, the church became God’s vehicle for gospel and kingdom proclamation in this age between the two comings of Jesus. God is still saving a remnant of Israelites (Rom. 11:1–6), but in this age the church is the messenger of God’s kingdom program, taking the gospel to all nations. When God saves the mass of national Israel in the future (Rom. 11:26) Israel will once again have a mediatorial role of service and leadership to the nations under Jesus the Messiah who at that time will be ruling the nations (Isa. 2:2–4; Matt. 19:28; Rev. 19:15). But in this age the church is the primary agent for God’s kingdom purposes.”</p>

              <li class="fragment"><strong>Easy</strong>: Apply promises and obey commands reaffirmed in the NT (e.g., promise of forgiveness, commands to love God and neighbor, not murder, etc.).</li>
              <li class="fragment"><strong>Somewhat easy</strong>: Learn about God’s character and way of relating to humans from the text (ladder of abstraction).</li>
              <li class="fragment"><strong>A bit harder</strong>: Recognizing the differences of administration between the OT and the NT and the centrality of Jesus in God’s plans, transpose the message of the text for our time and place (Israel as a paradigm).</li>

            <p class="small">(Simplified from Gentry and Wellum,<br /><em>God’s Kingdom through God’s Covenants</em>, p. 39)</p>
            <p class="left medium">Typology is <strong>a way of interpreting</strong> Old Testament <strong>patterns (types)</strong> that <strong>God intended</strong> to be previews of their New Testament <strong>fulfillment (antitypes)</strong> in Jesus or his work, in both his first and second comings.</p>
            <ul class="small">
              <li class="fragment">The type (OT pattern) relates <em>organically</em> to the antitype (its NT fulfillment).</li>
              <li class="fragment">The type is prophetic, which means God means for and ensures that the type is fulfilled.</li>
              <li class="fragment">The type is lesser, the antitype is greater.</li>

            <h3>Hebrews 8:5 and 9:24</h3>
            <p class="left">They serve a copy and shadow of the heavenly things. For when Moses was about to erect the tent, he was instructed by God, saying, “See that you make everything according to the <strong>pattern</strong> (<em>tupos</em>) that was shown you on the mountain.” (Heb 8:5)</p>
            <p class="left fragment">For Christ has entered, not into holy places made with hands, which are <strong>copies</strong> (<em>antitupa</em>) of the true things, but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God on our behalf. (Heb 9:24)</p>
